# Time Series Air Quality Index Analysis

This project focuses on forecasting air quality variables using machine learning algorithms applied to the 'Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality' dataset obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset comprises hourly atmospheric measurements from 12 cities, including pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3, along with meteorological variables. Our goal is to develop accurate predictive models to forecast these variables, aiding in air quality management and public health initiatives. To achieve this, we employ various machine learning algorithms, including SARIMA, Prophet, VAR, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The SARIMA model captures both seasonal and non-seasonal variations in the data, while Prophet excels in handling strong seasonal effects. VAR models enable us to analyze dynamic interdependencies among multiple variables. Additionally, MLP neural networks offer flexibility in capturing complex temporal patterns. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these models
in forecasting air quality variables. Our contributions include identifying optimal model configurations, assessing predictive accuracy, and providing insights into the underlying patterns and dynamics of air pollution. These findings offer valuable guidance for policymakers and environmental agencies in mitigating air pollution and improving public health.
